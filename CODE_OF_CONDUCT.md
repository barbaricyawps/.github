# Good Docs Code of Conduct - DRAFT PROOF OF CONCEPT

This document is currently a work in progress.

In October 2020, we created a Code of Conduct committee to draft the first
Code of Conduct file and create a process for handling conduct reports. If
you would like to join the Code of Conduct committee, join our community
Slack and mention your interest in the `#general` channel.
