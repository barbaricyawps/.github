# The Good Docs - DRAFT PROOF OF CONCEPT

Welcome to the Good Docs project! If you are an open-source developer looking
for high-quality documentation templates to improve and enhance your project's
docs, you've come to the right place!


## What is the Good Docs project?

The goal of the Good Docs is to improve the overall quality of documentation in
open source. To achieve this goal, we've assembled a community of technical
writers and developers to create high-quality templates for a variety of
documentation needs. Visit the [Good Docs website](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/)
